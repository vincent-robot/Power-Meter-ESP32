# Power-Meter-ESP32

This project goal is to be able to mesure real time power cunsumption at any cable level.
Data are send throught the wifi to a MQTT gateway and then use wih openhab.

The project is based on and ESP32 (<10€) and SCT-013 10A/1V sensor (~10€).

As I am new to ESP32, I needed to setup a dev environnement. My journey is described <a href="https://github.com/vincent-robot/Power-Meter-ESP32/blob/main/EnvSetup.md"> here</a> .
