# IDE installation

I am using Ubuntu 22.04.

I installed aduino IDE.

`sudo snap install arduino`


Then I installed the ESP32 boardmanager in Arduino IDE
I follow this procedure <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/ > here</a> 

It went very well for me.
I selected /devttyUSB0 as serial port and didn't forgot to set portmonitor to 115200 bauds.
